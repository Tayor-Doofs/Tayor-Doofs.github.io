### PROJECTS
	DYNAMIC RISK RATING MODEL – Work Related Project						August 2022
•	Utilized python, powerbi, sql, and excel to categorize merchants into three distinct risk levels, each associated with a specific score band rating ranging from low to high risk.
•	Each merchant is rated based on several parameters. A score is assigned to each parameter per merchant based on merchant’s transaction history and properties.
•	Utilized python to create a connection with the database. This allowed me to write SQL queries to pull in data from the database, transform the data with python.
•	The final output serves as an input to a new table in the database that stores merchant’s risk rating.



DATA VISUALIZATION TO ANALYZE STUDENT PERFORMANCE – Project Link				August 2022
•	Used pygadmin to connect to school’s database and used SQL to spool data relevant to the questions asked.
•	Utilized Python on Jupyter notebook to clean and transform data.
•	Imported clean data to PowerBI, created calculated measures and columns, and relationships.
•	Designed a dashboard of 7 pages with each page analyzing different questions.

8 WEEK SQL CHALLENGE – Project Link								February 2023
•	This project contained 8 different case studies with each case study with a minimum of 10 business problems.
•	Developed a minimum of 80 complex SQL queries to answer these business problems.
•	Queries involving window functions, CTEs, DDLs, DMLs, schema creation, data cleaning, data transformation etc.

GLEANING INSIGHTS FROM RSVP MOVIE DATABASE – Project Link 					September 2023
•	Utilized SQL to create the RSVP schema and the respective tables in it.
•	Each table was stored in separate sheets in an excel file and I re-saved each table into a csv file to enable Table Data Import Wizard to be used to import the data into the respective tables.
•	Performed some data cleaning on each table as some fields contained irregularities.
•	Applied complex queries such as JOIN, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTES to solve 30 business problems.

USING DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER ON AN IMBALANCED DATASET – Personal Project			October 2023
•	Utilized numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn to load an iris dataset from sklearn.datasets, make the current dataset imbalanced, split the dataset into a test and a train datasets.
•	Model training with Decision Tree Classifier, model evaluation with confusion matrix, f1 score, and g-mean metric.
•	Visualized data with Python.

HOUSE PRICES PREDICTION USING ADVANCED REGRESSION TECHNIQUES – Personal Project		October 2023
